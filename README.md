### It was ready for this:
We wanted a way to abstract away the implementation details to something that was already practically there from an interface perspective. Abstract directives for these data types, like push(), pop(), etc., are well understood, and are ready for a syntax that is seperate from any underlying language.

Poseidon Plugins will give you the implementation of choice that works with the Poseidon/Hydra Syntax features of this plugin.
