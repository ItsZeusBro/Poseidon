//A Transformation takes a vector and applies either an 
//1) independent transformation to each charachteristic in the vector or
//2) a single transformation across the entire vector, or 
//3) a transformation for each charachteristic that is relative to 
//the neigbors surrounding the characteristic or
//4) a transformation for each charachteristic that is dependent upon
//everything but the charachteristic itself
//Transformations reduce the complexity in the differences between 
//charachteristics, or increase the complexity in the differences between
//the charachteristics
//Transformations can be done in a pipeline, one after the other to
//provide a cumulative effect on the vector space that is hypothesized
//to increase predicitive yield for a given model.
