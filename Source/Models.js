//Models take a vector, finds distiction space between charachteristics
//in the vector, and makes predictions based on the distinction space
//in high or low dimensionality.
//Basically, a model will plot the vector space in whatever dimension
//the model works with, and try to find groupings or interdimensional
//lines that fits the plotted data, and then make a classification
//prediction based on the lines drawn between the points.
