//A Vectorizer is meant to formalize the charachteristic space of the examples
//In such a way that is consistent so that real mathematical relationships
//between the charachteristics can be highlighted without random noise
//So if you have a new example that has none of the charachteristics provided
//by the vectorizer, the vectorizer would yield nothing for the example rendering
//it a useless example.
//The more charachteristics shared between a vector and the example, 
//the better the vectorizer will be able to represent the example
